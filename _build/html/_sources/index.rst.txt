Welcome to Django Access Point documentation!
==============================================

Django Access Point is a package designed to streamline the creation of APIs for user
and role management in SaaS projects. It simplifies ``authentication``, ``authorization``, ``user management``,
and ``role-based access control``, enabling developers to build robust and scalable applications
with ease.

Additionally, this package provides a viewset for ``creating CRUD`` (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs easily for `developers`. It also supports ``custom fields`` allowing `users` to manage their own specific fields for each module without coding.

For more details, `Click here to view the PIP Package <https://pypi.org/project/django-access-point/>`_.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the package.
