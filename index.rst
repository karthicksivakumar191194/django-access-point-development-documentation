Welcome to Django Access Point documentation!
==============================================

Django Access Point is a powerful package designed to simplify the creation of APIs for user authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and user management in SaaS projects. It provides robust features for streamlining the process of building APIs that manage users, roles, and permissions, as well as offering flexible support for custom fields across modules.

This package is ideal for developers looking to implement user and role management, and it also supports custom field management, which means users can configure their own fields for any module without additional code.

**Key Features:**
    * ``User Authentication``: Easily manage authentication logic for user accounts.
    * ``Role-based Access Control (RBAC)``: Assign roles to users and control access to different modules based on those roles.
    * ``CRUD API Generation``: Automatically create full CRUD APIs for models, reducing boilerplate code.
    * ``Custom Fields``: Enable users to manage custom fields for each module dynamically.

how to :ref:`installation` the package.
